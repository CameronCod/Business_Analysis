# Problem Definition
 The hospitality industry in South Africa plays a crucial role in the country’s economic and tourism development, yet
many hotels face significant challenges in managing and interpreting guest feedback effectively. Each day,
thousands of customer reviews are posted on platforms such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews.
These reviews contain valuable insights about guest experiences, service quality, cleanliness, staff behaviour,
and overall satisfaction. However, most hotels rely on manual reading and summarisation of reviews, which is
time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. As a result, management teams often fail to detect
negative trends or recurring service problems early enough to take corrective action. This leads to customer
dissatisfaction, poor online ratings, and potential revenue loss, particularly in competitive tourist regions where
reputation is key. The proposed solution aims to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) to automatically analyse and classify guest reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.  Implementing this AI solution will not only enhance the operational efficiency of individual hotels but also strengthen the local tourism industry, boost regional economic activity, and create employment opportunities through improved service delivery and increased guest retention.
 
 # Business Objectives
1.Automate the analysis of guest reviews using AI and NLP.
2.Identify common guest concerns such as cleanliness, staff attitude, and room quality.
3.Provide management with real-time dashboards that summarise customer satisfaction trends.
4.Reduce the time and cost spent on manual review analysis.
5.Support evidence-based decision-making to improve service delivery and competitiveness.

 # Business Success Criteria
 -Achieve at least 85% accuracy in classifying review sentiments.
-Reduce manual review processing time by 50%.
-Generate weekly insights highlighting top three guest concerns.
-Improve average hotel rating scores within six months of implementation.

 # Constraints & Risks
 - Data privacy and access issues for online reviews.
 - Model misclassification of sarcasm or complex text.
 - Unbalanced dataset (more positive than negative reviews).

 # AI Solution Overview
 -The proposed solution uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically analyse hotel guest reviews.
 -The system collects reviews from online platforms, cleans the text, and applies a machine learning model to classify each review as positive, neutral, or negative. 
 -This helps hotel management quickly identify areas that need improvement, such as service quality or cleanliness.
-The results are displayed on a dashboard that shows overall guest satisfaction, trends over time, and most common issues. 
-This AI system saves time, reduces human error, and helps hotels make faster, data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and strengthen their reputation in the local tourism market.
 
 # Machine Learning Approach
 - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, LSTM, BERT.
 - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy,F1-Score, Confusion Matrix. 
 - Tools: Python, NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.

 # Dataset
 - Kaggle “Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” dataset. - Custom feedback from hotel management
 systems. - Data Fields: Review text, rating, location, and timestamp.
 
 # Model & Evaluation
 The dataset will be split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. Text preprocessing will be
 done using NLP techniques before training classifiers. The model’s performance will be evaluated
 using accuracy and F1-score metrics, with confusion matrix visualization to analyze
 misclassifications.
 Solution Techniques- Text preprocessing and tokenization. - Feature extraction using TF-IDF. - Deep learning sentiment
 classification using LSTM. - Topic modeling (LDA) for identifying recurring issues.
 Additional AI Features- Sentiment trend dashboard. - Chatbot to summarize guest feedback. - Speech-to-text analysis for
 voice reviews.

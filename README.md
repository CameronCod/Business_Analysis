# Problem Definition
 Hotels receive hundreds of guest reviews through online platforms and surveys, making it difficult
 for management to manually analyze and identify patterns in customer satisfaction. This often
 results in delayed responses to guest complaints and missed opportunities to improve service
 quality. The proposed AI-driven solution will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
 automatically analyze text reviews, classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and
 highlight common topics such as cleanliness, staff behavior, and food quality. This automation
 enables hotels to quickly respond to guest feedback, improve service delivery, and increase
 customer retention, aligning with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) objectives by integrating
 smart AI solutions into business processes.
 
 # Business Objectives
1. Improve guest satisfaction through AI-driven sentiment monitoring. 
2. Identify recurring customer issues and service gaps.
3. Provide management with a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard.
4. Support data-driven decisions for improving hotel services.

 # Business Success Criteria
 - Achieve at least 90% model accuracy in sentiment prediction.
 - Reduce guest complaint response time by 50%. 
 - Increase customer satisfaction ratings by at least 0.5 stars within 6 months.
 
 # Constraints & Risks
 - Data privacy and access issues for online reviews.
 - Model misclassification of sarcasm or complex text.
 - Unbalanced dataset (more positive than negative reviews).

 # AI Solution Overview
 This AI solution will apply NLP and deep learning techniques to analyze guest feedback
 automatically. The model will preprocess text (tokenization, lemmatization), extract features
 (TF-IDF), and train classifiers such as Naïve Bayes or LSTM neural networks. The results will be
 visualized in an interactive dashboard, showing overall sentiment trends and top service issues.
 
 # Machine Learning Approach
 - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, LSTM, BERT.
 - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy,F1-Score, Confusion Matrix. 
 - Tools: Python, NLTK, SpaCy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.

 # Dataset
 - Kaggle “Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” dataset. - Custom feedback from hotel management
 systems. - Data Fields: Review text, rating, location, and timestamp.
 
 # Model & Evaluation
 The dataset will be split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets. Text preprocessing will be
 done using NLP techniques before training classifiers. The model’s performance will be evaluated
 using accuracy and F1-score metrics, with confusion matrix visualization to analyze
 misclassifications.
 Solution Techniques- Text preprocessing and tokenization. - Feature extraction using TF-IDF. - Deep learning sentiment
 classification using LSTM. - Topic modeling (LDA) for identifying recurring issues.
 Additional AI Features- Sentiment trend dashboard. - Chatbot to summarize guest feedback. - Speech-to-text analysis for
 voice reviews.

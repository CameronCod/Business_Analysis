# Business Background
The hospitality industry in South Africa is one of the most influential contributors to the country’s economy and tourism sector.
Major tourist destinations such as Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg attract millions of visitors annually, making hotel service quality a key factor in regional competitiveness. In the digital era, most guests share their experiences on online platforms such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. However, many hotels still rely on manual methods to interpret this feedback, which are time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error.
This project proposes the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically analyse guest reviews. By converting unstructured text into measurable insights, hotels can identify customer satisfaction trends, detect recurring service issues, and make informed business decisions. This system aims to enhance guest experience, improve hotel performance, and strengthen South Africa’s local tourism economy.

# Problem Definition
 The hospitality industry in South Africa plays a crucial role in the country’s economic and tourism development, yet
many hotels face significant challenges in managing and interpreting guest feedback effectively. Each day,
thousands of customer reviews are posted on platforms such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews.
These reviews contain valuable insights about guest experiences, service quality, cleanliness, staff behaviour,
and overall satisfaction. However, most hotels rely on manual reading and summarisation of reviews, which is
time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. As a result, management teams often fail to detect
negative trends or recurring service problems early enough to take corrective action. This leads to customer
dissatisfaction, poor online ratings, and potential revenue loss, particularly in competitive tourist regions where
reputation is key. The proposed solution aims to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) to automatically analyse and classify guest reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.  Implementing this AI solution will not only enhance the operational efficiency of individual hotels but also strengthen the local tourism industry, boost regional economic activity, and create employment opportunities through improved service delivery and increased guest retention.
 
 # Business Objectives
1.Automate the analysis of guest reviews using AI and NLP.
2.Identify common guest concerns such as cleanliness, staff attitude, and room quality.
3.Provide management with real-time dashboards that summarise customer satisfaction trends.
4.Reduce the time and cost spent on manual review analysis.
5.Support evidence-based decision-making to improve service delivery and competitiveness.

 # Business Success Criteria
 -Achieve at least 85% accuracy in classifying review sentiments.
-Reduce manual review processing time by 50%.
-Generate weekly insights highlighting top three guest concerns.
-Improve average hotel rating scores within six months of implementation.

 # Constraints & Risks
 - Data privacy and access issues for online reviews.
 - Model misclassification of sarcasm or complex text.
 - Unbalanced dataset (more positive than negative reviews).

 # AI Solution Overview
 -The proposed solution uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically analyse hotel guest reviews.
 -The system collects reviews from online platforms, cleans the text, and applies a machine learning model to classify each review as positive, neutral, or negative. 
 -This helps hotel management quickly identify areas that need improvement, such as service quality or cleanliness.
-The results are displayed on a dashboard that shows overall guest satisfaction, trends over time, and most common issues. 
-This AI system saves time, reduces human error, and helps hotels make faster, data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and strengthen their reputation in the local tourism market.

# Functional Requirements 
-System must import hotel reviews (CSV)
-Text must be cleaned and pre-processed before analysis
-Reviews must be classified into sentiment categories
-Dashboards must show trends and frequent complaint themes
-Ability to export reports

# Non-Functional Requirements 
-Dashboard response time within 5 seconds
-Secure handling of text-only (no personal data)
-Easy-to-use interface
-Scalable to multiple hotels

# Community & local Municipality benefits 
Improving guest experiences increases local tourism demand, helping nearby businesses such as restaurants and transport services grow.
Better hotel performance leads to job creation, increased economic activity, and alignment with South Africa’s 4IR transformation goals, uplifting local communities and boosting tourism regions.
 
 # Data & Model summary 
 -Dataset: kaggle "Booking.com"

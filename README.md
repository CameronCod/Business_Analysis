AI Solution : Shortage of staff impacts the quality of service, reviews, manual check in delay. AI can help by taking on responsibilities. For example, it could manage reservation changes, update guest profiles, or even schedule housekeeping tasks base on real-time room availability, by offloading these adminsistrative burdens.

Business Objectives
- High Occupancy Rates: Keep a high percentage of booked rooms throughout the year.
- Increase Guest Satisfaction: Deliver good customer service to boost reviews, referrals and repeat bookings.
- Improve Operational Efficiency: Reduce costs without compromising service quality through technology and staff training.
- Strengthen Brand Reputation: Build trust and loyalty through consistent quality, environmental responsibility, and community involvement.
- Promote Sustainability: Implement eco-friendly practices like waste reduction, energy conservation and local sourcing.

Business Success Criteria
- Occupancy rate of over 75% year-round.
- Guest satisfaction rating of 4.5-5 on review platforms.
- Revenue growth of at least 10% annually.
- Operational cost savings of around 5–10% per year through efficiency measures.
- Repeat guest rate of over 30%.

# Business Background
Hotel is an important component of the hospitality industry, providing paid accommodation, food and and other services to guests. They cater to a group of diverse individuals, including tourists, business guest and local guests. The business environment is influenced by economic conditions, travel trends and consumer technology, such as online booking platforms and review websites. The focus is to create a positive guest experience while managing operations to ensure profitability.

# Requirements
To ensure the successful implementation of the AI hotel management system, several key functional and non-functional requirements must be met.
 Functional Requirements:
- Reservation Management: AI must process changes, cancellations, and upgrades.
- Guest Profile Updates: Automatically maintain guest history, preferences, and loyalty status.
- Housekeeping Scheduling: Assign cleaning tasks based on real-time room availability and guest status.
- Automated Check-in/Check-out: Enable self-service through kiosks or mobile applications.
- Operational Insights: Generate real-time reports on occupancy, service status, and guest feedback.

 Non-Functional Requirements:
- Reliability: System must operate 24/7 with minimal downtime.
- Data Security: Ensure guest data is protected in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- User-Friendly Design: Easy-to-navigate interfaces for staff and guests.
- Scalability: Able to support expansion across multiple properties or hotel chains.
- Multi-language Support: Cater to international guests through localized experiences.

# Constraints
The project must be designed and implemented within the following limitations:
- Budget Constraints: Financial resources may restrict the scope or speed of implementation.
- Legacy Systems: Existing hotel software may limit integration or require upgrades.
- Regulatory Compliance: Must adhere to local labor laws and international data privacy standards.

# Risks
Potential risks that could impact the success of the AI solution include:

Technical Risks:
- AI errors in managing bookings or misinterpreting guest requests.
- System failures or bugs are causing delays in check-ins or room assignments.
- Integration difficulties with outdated or proprietary systems.

 Operational Risks:
- Resistance from staff unwilling to adopt new technologies.
- Loss of the personal touch that guests expect in hospitality.
- Misuse or underutilization of the system due to insufficient training.

 Security & Compliance Risks:
- Data breaches or leaks of personal guest information.
- Legal action due to non-compliance with data protection laws.

 Reputational Risks:
- Negative guest experiences caused by AI mistakes (e.g., wrong room, poor service, untidyness , wrong schedule ).
  
# Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques
AI Tools and Techniques:
-Natural Language Processing : Responds to guest inquiries via chatbot or email. It reduces front-desk workload
-Robotic Process Automation : Automates repetitive tasks(sending confirmations) , reduces manual administrative work and errors
-Computer Vision : Supports and makes it easier for guests to check in using ID verification or facial recognition
-Sentiment Analysis Tools : Monitors Online reviews and guest feedback to detect service issues

Intergration Tools:
-Cloud Platforms(e.g Azure) : Used to host the AI application and ensuring that the system rums 24/7

Data Management Tools:
-Database Management Systems(e.g.MySQL) : Can be used to store guest profiles and reservations

# Problem definition
What is the problem?:
- Hotels in our region are facing ongoing staff shortages, leading to slower check-ins, delayed housekeeping, and reduced responsiveness to guest requests.
-  This lowers service quality, results in poor online reviews, and decreases repeat bookings, which in turn reduces occupancy rates and revenue.

How relevant is it to the theme?:
- The issue aligns with the theme “AI Solution for Industries” because AI can take over repetitive tasks such as managing reservations, updating guest profiles, scheduling housekeeping, and answering guest queries.

How beneficial it will be in solving the problem?:
- By solving this problem with AI, hotels can maintain service quality despite limited staff. 
- This will improve guest satisfaction, protect the hotel’s reputation, and increase revenue.
- The local municipality will also benefit from sustained tourism, more visitor spending in local businesses, and stable contributions from tourism-related taxes, helping the community’s economy grow.

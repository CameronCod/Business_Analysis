*Problem Definition
Hotels receive hundreds of guest reviews through online platforms and surveys, making it difficult
for management to manually analyze and identify patterns in customer satisfaction. This often
results in delayed responses to guest complaints and missed opportunities to improve service
quality. The proposed AI-driven solution will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
automatically analyze text reviews, classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and
highlight common topics such as cleanliness, staff behavior, and food quality. This automation
enables hotels to quickly respond to guest feedback, improve service delivery, and increase
customer retention, aligning with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) objectives by integrating
smart AI solutions into business processes.
*Business Objectives
1. Improve guest satisfaction through AI-driven sentiment monitoring. 2. Identify recurring customer
issues and service gaps. 3. Provide management with a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard. 4.
Support data-driven decisions for improving hotel services.
Business Success Criteria
- Achieve at least 90% model accuracy in sentiment prediction. - Reduce guest complaint response
time by 50%. - Increase customer satisfaction ratings by at least 0.5 stars within 6 months.
Constraints & Risks
- Data privacy and access issues for online reviews. - Model misclassification of sarcasm or
complex text. - Unbalanced dataset (more positive than negative reviews).
*AI Solution Overview
This AI solution will apply NLP and deep learning techniques to analyze guest feedback
automatically. The model will preprocess text (tokenization, lemmatization), extract features
(TF-IDF), and train classifiers such as Na√Øve Bayes or LSTM neural networks. The results will be
visualized in an interactive dashboard, showing overall sentiment trends and top service issues.
